Anshitha | Section-02 | My instructor is Dr. Case/10 A.M.

Hello. My name is Naga Anshitha Velagapudi and I'm currently in my first semester of Master's in Applied Computer Science.

I'm from Vijayawada, India. I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Dhanekula Institute of Engineering and Technology in 2018. I worked as Assistant System Engineer in A.D.S solutions located in Bangalore for a year before coming to Master's. In my leisure time I'll listen to songs, read novels. My hobbies are playing indoor games like chess, caroms etc. 

Even though I'm from CS background, I want to dive deeper into coding as I'm interested to develop web pages and applications as soon as I graduate from here. Looking forward to work with you all.
