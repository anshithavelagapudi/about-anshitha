                  Hello. My name is Naga Anshitha Velagapudi and I'm currently in my first semester of Master's in Applied Computer Science.

                  <h2>Background</h2>
                  
                  I'm from Vijayawada, India. I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Dhanekula Institute of Engineering and Technology in 2018. I worked as Assistant System Engineer in A.D.S solutions located in Bangalore for a year before coming to Master's. In my leisure time I'll listen to songs, read novels. My hobbies are playing indoor games like chess, caroms etc.

                <h2>Plans</h2>
             
                Even though I'm from CS background, I want to dive deeper into coding as I'm interested to develop web pages and applications as soon as I graduate from here. Looking forward to work with you all.
